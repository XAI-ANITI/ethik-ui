## Run

Build the static files from JSX files:

```
make front_dev
```

Start the Django development server:

```
make back_dev
```

There are well-formatted datasets in `data` that can be loaded from the interface.

## Code structure

The code is a Django project with two apps: `api` and `frontend`. `api` just
defines views to receive requests that call `ethik` features. `frontend` is a
ReactJS app that builds static files served by Django.

```
api/: A Django app for back-end
data/: Datasets that can be loaded from the web interface
ethik_ui/: The Django project
frontend/: A Django app for frontend
  js/: JSX files
  sass/: CSS files
  static/frontend/preprocessed/: Static files generated by webpack
```
